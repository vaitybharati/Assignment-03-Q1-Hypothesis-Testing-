A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.

Assume Null hyposthesis as Ho: μ1 = μ2 (There is no difference in diameters of cutlets between two units).

Thus Alternate hypothesis as Ha: μ1 ≠ μ2 (There is significant difference in diameters of cutlets between two units) 2 Sample 2 Tail test applicable
